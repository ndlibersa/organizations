http://coral-erm.org/documentation.

UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.3. TO 1.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a security fix. No database changes have been made, just upgrade the code usual. 

UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.2 TO 1.3
-----------------------------------------------------

This version of the Organization module includes database changes that
compliment the Issues feature added to the Resources module version 1.4.  In
order to to use the Resource module Issues feature, you need to update the
Resources module to 1.4 and set the following value in the Organizations
configuration.ini file. Any other value for this variable will cause the
Organizations module to use the Issue Log native to the Organizations module:

    * resourcesIssues=Y 

To install this upgrade, simply run the file 'upgrade.php' located in the
install directory and enter the database information. The database changes
will be installed automatically.

UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.1 TO 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------

No database changes are required for this upgrade.  However, to use the
Resources sidebar, you need to add the following value to your configuration.ini
file:

    * resourcesDatabaseName=[YOUR RESOURCES DATABASE NAME] 


UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.0 TO 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------

This upgrade contains coding and database structure changes only.  No changes
to the configuration file are required.

Database changes include:
    * Adding address field to contact and removing state and country fields
    * Update the address field to contain the previously used state and country data
    * Add view account tab indicator to User (for a future code-only upgrade)


To install this upgrade, simply run the file 'upgrade.php' located in the
install directory and enter the database information. The database changes
will be installed automatically.
